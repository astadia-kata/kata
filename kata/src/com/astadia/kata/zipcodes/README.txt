
In this package, you will find the stub code and tests for a data combining
exercise. There is no 'correct' answer but, an implementation is not considered
complete until the unit tests for that class pass.
There is an interface defined for the class to implement.
Create a new implementation of the interface for each day you work on the exercise.
There is a test case that can be extended for each implementation.
The class, ExampleMondayTest demonstrates how to do this

I strongly encourage writing more test cases to work out your algorithm. Also,
as you learn to work with the standard API write tests that help to understand
how the API works (instead of system.out.println). These tests can serve as
'notes' later on. Keep any new tests in your package.

See the specification.html file for implementation instructions.
The javadocs for com.idea.exercise.zipcodes.IZipDataCombiner provide a more
brief specification.
