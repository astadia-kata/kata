<h1>Combining Zip Codes</h1>

<p>
	In this package, you will find the stub code and tests for an Array Search
	exercise. There is no 'correct' answer but, an implementation is not considered
	complete until the unit tests for that class pass.
</p>
<p>
	To implement, simply replace the thrown exception:
	<tt>throw new UnsupportedOperationException("implement me");</tt>
	with your implementation. You can run tests by simply right clicking the
	corresponding test class and selecting <tt>run as->junit</tt>.
</p>
<p>
	I strongly encourage writing more test cases to work out your algorithm. Also,
	as you learn to work with the standard API write tests that help to understand
	how the API works (instead of <tt>system.out.println</tt>tt>). These tests can serve as
	'notes' later on. Keep any new tests in your package.
</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
	In this exercise, the scenario is, you are creating a site to allow
	querying for broadband providers based on a user's zip code.
</p>
<p>
	You implementation will be passed sets of data containing a provider name
	and the zip codes supported by that provider.
	It should then be able to return an array of providers that support a
	given zip code.
</p>
<p>
	The files can be found in the
	<tt>com.idea.exercise.zipcodes</tt>
	package.
