<h1>Array Chop</h1>

<p>
	In this package, you will find the stub code and tests for an Array Search
	exercise. There is no 'correct' answer but, an implementation is not considered
	complete until the unit tests for that class pass.
</p>
<p>
	To implement, simply replace the thrown exception:
	<tt>throw new UnsupportedOperationException("implement me");</tt>
	with your implementation. You can run tests by simply right clicking the
	corresponding test class and selecting <tt>run as->junit</tt>.
</p>
<p>
	I strongly encourage writing more test cases to work out your algorithm. Also,
	as you learn to work with the standard API write tests that help to understand
	how the API works (instead of <tt>system.out.println</tt>). These tests can serve as
	'notes' later on. Keep any new tests in your package.

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
	A binary chop (sometimes called the more prosaic binary search) finds
	the position of value in a sorted array of values. It achieves some
	efficiency by halving the number of items under consideration each time
	it probes the values: in the first pass it determines whether the
	required value is in the top or the bottom half of the list of values.
	In the second pass in considers only this half, again dividing it in to
	two. It stops when it finds the value it is looking for, or when it runs
	out of array to search. Binary searches are a favorite of CS lecturers.
</p>

<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>
	Write a binary chop method that takes an integer search target and a
	sorted array of integers. It should return the integer index of the
	target in the array, or -1 if the target is not in the array. The
	signature will logically be:
</p>
<tt>chop(int, array_of_int)  -&gt; int</tt>
