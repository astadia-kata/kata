<h1>Numbers</h1>

<p>
	In this package, you will find the stub code and tests for an Adding Numbers
	exercise. There is no 'correct' answer but, an implementation is not considered
	complete until the unit tests for that class pass.
</p>
<p>
	To implement, simply have the body of each method return the expected result in the test class. You can run tests by simply right clicking the
	corresponding test class and selecting <tt>run as->junit</tt> in the test_src directory NumberWorkTest</p>
