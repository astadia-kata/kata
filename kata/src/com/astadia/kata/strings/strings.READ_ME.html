<h1>ParseStr</h1>

<p>
	In this package, you will find the stub code and tests for parsing a string. There is no 'correct' answer but, an implementation is not considered
	complete until the unit tests for that class pass.
</p>
<p>
	<p>
	To implement, simply have the body of each method return the expected result in the test class. You can run tests by simply right clicking the
	corresponding test class and selecting <tt>run as-&gt;junit</tt> in the test_src directory StringParseTest</p></p>
