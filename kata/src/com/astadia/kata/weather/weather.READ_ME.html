<h1>Weather Data Parsing</h1>

<p>In this package, you will find the stub code and tests for a data parsing
exercise. There is no 'correct' answer but, an implementation is not considered
complete until the unit tests for that class pass.
There is a stub and test for each day of the week. The class names are preceded
with the name of the day. We would like to have a different implementation for
each day.</p>

<p>You are strongly encouraged to write as many test cases as needed to work out your algorithm. Also,
as you learn to work with the standard API write tests that help to understand
how the API works (instead of system.out.println). These tests will serve as
'notes' later on. Keep all your tests in the corresponding test package.</p>

<h3>Parsing Weather Data</h3>
<p>
Parsing text is often a painful experience, in any programming language. 
Many legacy systems store (and transmit) data in similar flat-file formats
where the position of the data has significance. I expect you may see a correlation
between this exercise and systems you have had to work with in the past.
Hopefully, by completing this exercise, you will have some new techniques
and notes to serve later on.
</p>

<p>There are 2 files (weather.dat, weather2.dat) supplied for this exercise located in the same package with the tests. 
In both files you will find daily weather data for Morristown, NJ for June 2002. The data you are interested in are in the 
first 3 columns Column 1 (Dy) = Day Number, Column 2 (MxT) = Max Temperature, and Column 3(MnT) is the Min Temperature.
Your objective is to write a program to output the Day(s) with the smallest smallest temperature variance (low to high).

<h3>Hints</h3>
<ul>
<li>
An easy way to read data from an InputStream one line at a time is with a
java.io.BufferedReader, which can be instantiated with a java.io.InputStreamReader
</li>
<li>
Regular Expressions (java.util.regex.*)
</li>
<li>
java.util.Scanner (java 1.5)
</li>
<li>
java.nio.CharBuffer
</li>
<li>
java.util.StringTokenizer
</li>
<li>
even handrolled parsing through a string or bytes
</li>
</ul>

	The files can be found in the test_src source folder in the 
	<tt>com.astadia.kata.weather</tt>
	package.
